Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality systems.
Some of the importance of software engineering include; 

-Reliability and Quality – Well-engineered software is less likely to have bugs or security flaws, making it more dependable for users.
-Scalability – As businesses grow, they need software that can handle more users and data without crashing or slowing down.
-Efficiency – Software engineers use best practices and tools to create programs that run smoothly and optimize system performance.
-Security – With cyber threats on the rise, software engineers play a crucial role in protecting data and ensuring digital safety.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Development of programming languages e.g. C-  High-level languages like C made coding more efficient and portable.
-The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s-  Recognized as a discipline to solve the "Software Crisis
-The advent of structured programming in the 1970s-Improved code organization and maintainability 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   -Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. Waterfall Methodology – Linear and structured approach, best for projects with clear requirements for example building an airport control system.  
2. Agile Methodology– Iterative and flexible approach, best for fast-changing projects for example mobile app development

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  -Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) – Provide tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one platform, improving productivity and efficiency for example Visual Studio
Version Control Systems (VCS) – Track changes, enable collaboration, and prevent code loss, ensuring smooth development e.g., Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

-Debugging and Fixing Bugs – Use systematic debugging, logging tools, and test-driven development (TDD) to catch and fix errors early.
-Managing Project Deadlines – Follow Agile methodologies, set realistic goals, and use project management tools like Jira or Trello.
-Keeping Up with New Technologies – Continuously learn through online courses, coding communities, and tech conferences.
-Handling Technical Debt – Regularly refactor code, document changes, and prioritize long-term maintainability over quick fixes.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

   -Unit Testing: Helps in testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Aids in testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Helps in testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs or prompts to optimize AI responses.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt – "Tell me about cars."
Improved Prompt – "Explain the key differences between electric and gasoline cars, including their environmental impact and cost."
Why It's More Effective – The improved prompt is clear, specific, and focused, guiding the AI to provide relevant and detailed information instead of a broad, unfocused response.
